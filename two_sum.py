# LeetCode 1 ‚Äì Two Sum
# Brute force approach

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]

# üîç Problem Explanation:

# Given an array of integers (nums) and a target value,
# return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.


# Example:
# nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: [0, 1] ‚Üí because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9


#  How This Code Works:

# - Loop through each pair of elements using two nested loops
# - For each pair (i, j), check if nums[i] + nums[j] == target
# - If it matches, return the indices [i, j]


# Learnings:

# - Practiced using nested loops to compare all combinations of two elements
# - Understood the brute force approach (try all possibilities)
# - Gained familiarity with index access and return values in Python



# Time Complexity: O(n^2)

# Since we are checking every possible pair, this is not the most efficient method,
# but it's a great way to understand the problem before optimizing it.
